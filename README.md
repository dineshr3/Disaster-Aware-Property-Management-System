 **Disaster-Aware-Property-Management-System**

Project Overview
Disaster-Aware Property Management System is a MATLAB-based tool developed to assess the impact of disasters on properties using image processing techniques. The system analyzes before-and-after images of properties to detect significant changes, such as damage caused by natural disasters (floods, fires, storms, etc.).

The project includes a dehazing module to enhance image clarity in foggy or low-visibility conditions, followed by image comparison to determine if a disaster has occurred and to what extent a property has been affected.

🧠 Key Objectives

🏚️ Detect property damage by comparing pre- and post-disaster images.

🌫️ Improve image quality using dehazing techniques.

📊 Provide automated visual analysis for disaster management and response teams.

✅ How It Works
- Input image pairs are loaded — one before and one after a potential disaster (e.g., 1.1.jpg and 1.2.jpg).
- Optional dehazing is applied to both images to improve clarity.
- The system performs a pixel-level comparison to detect changes.
- Results are displayed visually and optionally stored for record-keeping or integration with other systems.
